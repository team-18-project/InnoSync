    port: 5432
    user: "postgres"
    password: "postgres"
    dbname: "innosync"
    sslmode: "disable"
  jwt:
    secret_key: "your-secret-key-change-this-in-production"
    access_token_ttl: "15m"
    refresh_token_ttl: "168h"
  upload:
    max_file_size: 10485760
    upload_dir: "uploads"
    allowed_extensions: [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".pdf", ".doc", ".docx"]
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  go mod download
  ```
- Run database migrations (if any)
- Start the server:
  ```bash
  go run main.go
  ```
- API available at `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`

#### 2. Docker Compose (Recommended)

- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
- From the project root:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
- Services:
  - **db:** PostgreSQL (port 5432)
  - **backend:** Go API (port 3000)
  - **adminer:** DB UI (port 3001)

---

### Frontend Setup

- Install [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- From the `frontend` directory:
  ```bash
  flutter pub get
  flutter run
  ```
- To run on web/desktop, see [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/)

#### Linting & Code Quality
- Uses `flutter_lints` (see `analysis_options.yaml`)
- Run:
  ```bash
  flutter analyze
  ```
